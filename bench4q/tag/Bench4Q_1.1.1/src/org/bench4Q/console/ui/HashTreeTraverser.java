/**
 * By implementing this interface, a class can easily traverse a HashTree
 * object, and be notified via callbacks of certain events. There are three such
 * events:
 * <ol>
 * <li>When a node is first encountered, the traverser's
 * {@link #addNode(Object,HashTree)} method is called. It is handed the object
 * at that node, and the entire sub-tree of the node.</li>
 * <li>When a leaf node is encountered, the traverser is notified that a full
 * path has been finished via the {@link #processPath()} method. It is the
 * traversing class's responsibility to know the path that has just finished
 * (this can be done by keeping a simple stack of all added nodes).</li>
 * <li>When a node is retraced, the traverser's {@link #subtractNode()} is
 * called. Again, it is the traverser's responsibility to know which node has
 * been retraced.</li>
 * </ol>
 * To summarize, as the traversal goes down a tree path, nodes are added. When
 * the end of the path is reached, the {@link #processPath()} call is sent. As
 * the traversal backs up, nodes are subtracted.
 * <p>
 * The traversal is a depth-first traversal.
